**Where tax meets technology** ðŸš€

<div class="promise-callout" markdown="1">

### My Promise to Readers
> Everything you'll read here comes from my own experience, thinking, and work.  
> I sometimes use AI tools to help me research, test ideas, or express them clearly â€” but the substance, reasoning, and perspective are entirely my own.
>
> I'm deeply interested in data science and AI, and my work in tax provides rich opportunities for exploring meaningful, real-world applications of both.  
> This site is where I share those explorations â€” combining technical curiosity with practical domain expertise.
>
> I won't publish anything unless I understand it, believe in it, and consider it genuinely relevant to the evolving world of tax technology.
